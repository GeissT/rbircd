This software is an IRC daemon written in ruby by Yoann Guillot

To launch the daemon, you should use a script like this one:

----- snip run.rb -----
require 'ircd'

# change to put the name of your configuration file
ircd = Ircd.new('conf')

# respond to SIGHUP by reloading the src/conf
trap('HUP') { ircd.rehash }

# here we go
ircd.main_loop
----- snip -----

The server is controlled through a configuration file, here is a sample:

----- snip conf -----
# the server name (informative only)
N:my.eleet.server.com

# listening ports
P:127.0.0.1:6667
# accept SSL connections
P:127.0.0.1:7000:SSL
# yay ipv6
P:[::1]:6667

# link to other ircds
C:1.2.3.4:7001:mypassw0rd:RC4:ZIP

# operators: mask : salted MD5 pass : user mode
O:jj:*!bla@trusted.computing.lol:$1234$a123ef0d002828:OaARD
----- snip -----

More specific tweaks can be done in the source itself, especially the Conf class (holds ping timeout delays, ssl cert/key paths, etc)

IRC commands are in ircd_commands.rb (duh)

KTHXBAI
