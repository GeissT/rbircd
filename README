This software is an IRC daemon written in ruby by Yoann Guillot
License: WtfPLv2


It is *NOT* intended for heavy traffic, security against spam/bots, etc
Use at your own risks !
Also, when using one rbircd server in your irc network, you may introduce arbitrary flaws for the whole network !


To launch the daemon, you can run
 ruby -r ircd -e 'Ircd.run("my_config.txt")'
or
 ruby -r ircd -e 'Ircd.run_bg("my_config.txt", "irc_log.txt")'

The server will reload its source/configuration on SIGHUP

The server is controlled through a configuration file, here is a sample:

----- snip conf -----
# the server name/description
N:rb.ircd.net:my sexy server

# listening ports
P:127.0.0.1:6667
# accept SSL connections
P:127.0.0.1:7000:SSL
# ipv6
P:[::1]:6667

# link to other ircds
C:1.2.3.4:7001:mypassw0rd:RC4:ZIP

# operator identifier : mask : pass hash : user mode
# use oper_mkpass.rb to generate the hash
O:jj:*!bla@trusted.computing.lulz:1234$5678:oO
----- snip -----

More specific tweaks should be done in the source itself, especially the Conf class (holds ping timeout delays, ssl cert/key paths, etc)

IRC commands are in ircd_commands.rb (duh)


KTHXBAI
